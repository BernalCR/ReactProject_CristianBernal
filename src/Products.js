        description: "The unmistakable mark of Wilier Triestina in a road bike for leisure loving cyclists. For the 2017 season, its frame has been completely rethought and redesigned, with double-butted aluminium and technical details that give it a modern and technologically advanced look; from its integrated transmission cables to its 27.2 mm diameter seat-post, monocoque carbon fork, differentiated diameter head tube, and that angled top tube, now an unmistakable mark of high-end Wilier Triestina frames.",

        description: "With seven wins at Paris-Roubaix, our Roubaix has proven that Smoother is Faster. Until this moment, however, smooth has admittedly come with some compromises. But not anymore. The all-new Roubaix now delivers compliance without compromise by introducing a radical new Future Shock 1.5 that gives you more control on rough roads, a new Pavé seatpost that creates our most balanced Roubaix to date, aerodynamics that equal the Tarmac, and a Rider-First Engineered™ frame that’s shed some serious weight. Is it still comfortable? Sure, but don’t call it a comfort bike, because performance was behind every engineering decision we made. ",

        description: "All too often, corners are cut to meet price-points in the entry-level road bike market, but the Allez redefines what it means to be 'entry level.' Focusing on weight, refinement, and reliability like nothing else in its class, the Allez is the first to make these technologies accessible to everyone. Whether you're just getting into road cycling, commuting, or looking for a new bike, the Allez is just as performance-packed as it is versatile.",
